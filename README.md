# Machine Learning Projects: Titanic Survival Prediction & Iris Flower Classification

# Overview
This repository contains two machine learning projects aimed at demonstrating proficiency in data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using popular datasets.

# Projects

# Titanic Survival Prediction
Objective: Predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and fare.
Techniques: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests), and model evaluation.
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

# Iris Flower Classification
Objective: Classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions.
Techniques: Data visualization, model training (K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees), and model evaluation.
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
